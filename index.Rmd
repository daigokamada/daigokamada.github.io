I am a biologist with research experience focused on feeding ecology (fish) and aquatic ecology (plankton), In recent years, I have gained interest and experience in interdisciplinary research where biological sciences meet the social sciences. Also, I have love towards Linguistics. Aside from teaching English, Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese as foreign languages, I love the aspects of language in our daily social interactions and ways of thinking.

My professional experience has shown that, either in Biology, Socio- or Psycholinguistics, data science is crucial to understanding a phenomenon and telling a story. Like a detective work, asking the right questions and following the right clues are important.

As an eager data scientist, my interest is using data as a tool to answer research questions and test hypotheses. I am an avid R enthusiast, but my interests and work had lead me to learn other languages such as C, HTML and CSS. Another language I am diving into is Python for Neural Networking.

I am highly motivated, avid learner, independent, passionate, eager to collaborate in a team environment. Feel free to access my portfolio, curriculum and contact information on the links above.
