Some data can be presented be analyzed geospatially, finding patterns and answers that can follow or not geographical or political boundaries. 

During my research I have tackled a few analyses of geospatial data that are displayed above: survey map of fisheries survey with NAFO divisions; home range analysis of fish cath data, center of gravity of fish catch data according to year; positive and negative catch data with countour splines indicating higher catch.
